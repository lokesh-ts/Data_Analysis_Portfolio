#  Traffic Flow Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes traffic flow data to understand vehicle movement patterns at different time periods.  
The aim is to study traffic density, identify peak traffic hours, and visualize traffic trends using Python data libraries.

---
## Libraries Used
- **NumPy** – numerical calculations
- **Pandas** – data handling and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
---
## Dataset Description
The dataset is stored in a CSV file and includes the following columns:
- **Hour** – Time of the day (0–23)
- **Vehicles** – Number of vehicles recorded per hour
- **Day_Type** – Weekday or Weekend indicator
---
## Analysis Performed
- Analyzed vehicle count across different hours
- Compared traffic patterns for **weekday vs weekend**
- Identified **peak traffic hours**
- Calculated average traffic flow
---
##  Visualizations
- Bar chart showing **hourly traffic flow**
- Line plot comparing **weekday and weekend traffic**
- Clear labeling for easy interpretation
---
##  Key Insights
- Traffic volume increases during peak hours
- Weekday traffic is generally higher than weekend traffic
- Late night and early morning hours show low traffic density

##  How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries if not already installed
3. Run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python traffic_flow.py
